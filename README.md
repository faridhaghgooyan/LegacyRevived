## :dart: Goal ##

LegacyRevived is a project dedicated to revitalizing and refactoring an old codebase that dates back to about 6 years ago. Through this repository, I aim to showcase the step-by-step process of modernizing the code and improving its quality, readability, and maintainability.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of refactoring and highlight the transformation that can be achieved by applying software engineering best practices. By sharing my refactoring journey, I hope to inspire and educate fellow developers on the importance of continuous improvement and the impact it can have on legacy projects.
